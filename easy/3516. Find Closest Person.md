# Approach  
We calculate the absolute differences between `x` and `z`, and between `y` and `z`.  
- `|x - z|`: Distance of the first person from `z`  
- `|y - z|`: Distance of the second person from `z`  

If both distances are equal, return `0`.  
If the first person is closer, return `1`.  
Otherwise, return `2`.

Itâ€™s simple math, optimized, and runs in constant time.

# Complexity  
- **Time complexity:** $$O(1)$$  
- **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$  

# Code  
```python
class Solution:
    def findClosest(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> int:
        if abs(x - z) == abs(y - z):
            return 0
        return 1 if abs(x - z) < abs(y - z) else 2
